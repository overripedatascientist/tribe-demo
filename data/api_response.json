These discussions highlight key themes, including corporate accountability, ocean conservation, innovative solutions, and the role of activism.\n\n#### Key Themes and Messages\n\n1. **Urgency and Human Responsibility:**\n   Across social media, users stress the reality and urgency of climate change, with a viral message capturing the sentiment: \"It's happening. It's real. It's our fault. We can still fix it. We have all the tools and knowledge we need.\" This reflects a widespread acknowledgment of human responsibility and the necessity for immediate action to mitigate climate impacts.\n\n2. **Corporate Responsibility:**\n   A significant theme is the accountability of major corporations in contributing to global emissions. Posts highlight that \"100 corporations cause 71% of emissions,\" with ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and Chevron frequently named as top polluters. This underscores the demand for these companies to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their environmental footprint.\n\n3. **Positive Developments and Solutions:**\n   Many social media conversations focus on positive climate news and solutions. Notable examples include the Commonwealth Bank's commitment to divest from non-compliant fossil fuel companies and the potential of floatovoltaics, which could generate a substantial portion of electricity needs by covering a fraction of a country's water bodies with solar panels. These solutions highlight the potential for innovation to address climate challenges, including sea level rise.\n\n4. **Ocean Conservation:**\n   Strong emphasis is placed on protecting marine environments, particularly in the Pacific regions. Users call for the protection of the Pacific Remote Islands from industries like deep-sea mining and oil extraction, recognizing the importance of ocean conservation in combating climate change and its impacts on coastal communities.\n\n5. **Advocacy and Political Engagement:**\n   Social media users actively encourage political engagement and advocacy, using hashtags like #climateactionnow and #climatejusticenow to rally collective efforts. Posts also promote participation in climate movements, reinforcing the power of grassroots activism in driving systemic change.\n\n6. **Inclusive Movement Building:**\n   Messages on social media promote an optimistic view of climate activism, inviting individuals to \"Join us! It's exciting. There are careers and clear conscience waiting, incredible businesses to build, and a planet to save.\" This narrative empowers individuals and communities to engage actively in climate solutions.\n\n#### Direct Quotes from Social Media:\n- \"It's happening.
